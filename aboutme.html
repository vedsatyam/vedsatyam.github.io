        <h2 class="title">What exactly is Ved???</h2>
        <p class="text">Honestly, it's childish, silly, to an extent embarrassing... but no one's going to read these blogs anyway, so I can just put it out there.

            Its one of those Grade 2 fetishes, where people come up with their code names, and mine was Ved. The reason its Ved is because when I was a kid I told my family, by random, to call me Ved... and yea I named myself. Alright.. listen, if the brain can name itself BRAIN then I have some right to do so too.
            
            So, yea, embarrassingly enough, I named my self Ved in grade 2 or around that age group. And to add salt to the cringe, it means... DEVIL. Lemme explain how. So in Hindi, my first language, DEVTA is the term we use for Gods, and the short for that is DEV. You reverse those words and it becomes VEDüòà. Pretty sick, isn't it? (Sarcasm)
            
            The reason I thought I was a devil was, First, my parents used to call me a Shetan(which means devil in Hindi (again my first language)), Second, autocorrect always translates my name from Satyam to Satan. So, you see the trend.
            
            So yea, that's where Ved comes from. The reason I use it so much now is because when I was registering me tech company, Ved, for an account I was unsure about it and thought it'll be a trial so I used my old gmail-id which had Ved in it but it came out that I can only register once from my computer,(ip mess) so yea I just settled with Ved as my companies name. And now that I've gained so much interest in business I just use the name a lot in different places.
            
            But, I've actually started to like it, I don't look at it as a cringe thing, cus life is cringy on its own u gotta accept it, and it's more beautiful that way. Cus it helps make the memories that you remember.
            
            Slight topic change...
            Do this, for a moment close your eyes and remember a stupid thing you did or said, from your childhood. (I've told my dad to buy me a telescope so I can look at the earth while being on the earthü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). And don't tell me you didn't smile.
            So yea, being cringy is important.
            
            Back to Ved...
            
            So yea that's the "tragic story" behind Ved!!!
            
            And another really important note... most of the things I do with Ved are programming based, so computers and that technical stuff. I did some business with the company too but the name didn't really play a big role in that. It was for my personal project and I didn't add a single bit of Ved in the report. I'll talk more about my personal project in another post, cus again its related to Ved and this whole thing is about Ved, so why not... And for the people who don't know what personal project is, its this thing my school requires its Grade 10 students to do (and it's not optional, so you gotta do it). Everyone has to make a project that revolves around their interests.
